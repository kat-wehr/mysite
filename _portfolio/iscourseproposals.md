After transitioning to the College of Arts & Architecture at Penn State, one of my first course projects was proposing, designing, and developing an introductory course in art therapy. The course would be a general education offering, and it would help students meet their "IS" requirement (interdisciplinary studies) which was a recent addition the gen ed curriculum at the time. Our college is uniquely positioned to provide interdisciplinary perspectives on an array of topics. 
We contracted with a licensed art therapist who acted as the subject matter expert, and I provided the learning sciences lens to the partnership. Over the course of six months, we co-wrote the proposal to be examined and passed by our university's faculty senate curricular affairs committee and piloted the course in Spring 2019.
