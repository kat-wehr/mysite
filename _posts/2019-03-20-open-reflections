Open education has always been an interest of mine since I joined the OER Schema project early in my career at Penn State. Lately, I've been reading a ton of recent research about open movements in education and how other institutions are encouraging openness at their campuses. On my own campus, the open movement has been gaining traction with grants and and task force, and the discussion around the University of California system's "break up" with Elsevier has generated a lot of renewed interest in open publishing.  
Personally I have always been an advocate for open source. I started my career in education as a teacher with zero dollars to invest in anything for a classroom, so open source and freely available resources were all I could really use if I didn't want to teach from the (outdates) books I had in my classroom. I was constantly searching for fresh ways to teach texts like To Kill A Mockingbird and Romeo and Juliet. Exchanging good resources with other teachers was fun and it kept me interested in the job in a different way. 
Anyway, nowadays, the concept of "open" in education has expanded well beyond just freely sharing resources. It's basically a culture. One aspect of the "new wave" of openness that really caught my attention is the idea of being an open scholar and participating in scholarly work in open ways. There is a lot of great writing about this that goes in depth on open scholarship, but the short version that applies to me is making an effort to do scholarly work in open ways and share about it openly on publically accessible channels. So, this blog is a great first step. I'm already fairly active on Twitter, and my presentation slides are typically shared out during conferences on Twitter. 
But I saw a new opportunity when I set up this blog on GitHub, which coincided quite well with two other things going on in my life. In fall, I started my Ph.D. at Penn State, and last summer, the HAX project really picked up speed when I shared some of my thoughts on open education with my colleagues. Basically, if we could figure out a way to leverage the simplicity of setting up a blog on GitHub sites with an interface that meant people who weren't comfortable didn't have to mess around with code, we could in essence provide truly open content publishing to anyone with internet access. 
What we mean by "truly open" is that this content stands up to the 5Rs: 
- Retain (as in, changes in content are logged so that content lives on conceivably forever)
- Remix (take some content and mix it up with some other content for a different purpose)
- Reuse (this is the traditional sharing of resources)
- Revise (easy to update and change)
- Redistribute (easy to make sure that changes go out to wherever they need to go - aka, wherever content is being utilized)
