## PSU006: First Year Seminar in Business

As a master's-degree holding employee at Smeal College of Business, I was qualified to teach the Smeal-specific first year seminar course geared toward first year students who are either already enrolled in, or are interested in applying to, Smeal majors. The course is taught by a cadre of instructors every semester who work together on curriculum updates spearheaded by the undergraduate advising office. 

In my sections of PSU006, I wrote a companion set of tutorials for each week's topics. These tutorials exist at [https://courses.eldig-elmsln.vmhost.psu.edu/psu006/node/3](https://courses.eldig-elmsln.vmhost.psu.edu/psu006/node/3). View a sample lesson and my content outline below.
