I'm Katrina Wehr, an instructional designer and soon to be doctoral student at Penn State University in State College, PA. You may know me from various presentations about topics such OER Schema, ELMSLN, Capture Studio, and others. I came to PSU in 2015 to work at the Smeal College of Business's eLDIG team. Prior to that, I was an instructional technologist at Drexel Universityâ€™s LeBow College of Business in Philadelphia, PA. Before moving to Philadelphia, I worked in various eLearning design roles on a contract basis with private companies and K-12 and higher education institutions throughout Pennsylvania and the mid-Atlantic area, primarily developing courses and materials to train teachers in effective online/technology enhanced instructional strategies. You can find my CV elsewhere on this site. 

I earned my B.S. in Secondary Education here at Penn State in 2012 and went on to complete my M.Ed. in Instructional Design & Technology at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. While I was in graduate school I worked as a long-term substitute teacher and journalist. My journalism work has been published in various forms in both local and national news outlets.

I do occassionally take up freelance work. [Email me](mailto:{{site.email}}) to discuss your next project.
