I'm Katrina Wehr, a learning designer at Penn State University in State College, PA. You may know me from various presentations about topics such OER Schema, ELMSLN, Capture Studio, and others, or through my involvement in OLC events and activities. I came to PSU in 2015 to work at the Smeal College of Business's eLDIG team, and in 2018 I "jumped ship" to the College of Arts & Architecture. In the fall of 2018, I started my doctoral degree in Learning, Design, and Technology at Penn State. 

Prior to Penn State, I was an instructional technologist at Drexel Universityâ€™s LeBow College of Business in Philadelphia, PA. Before moving to Philadelphia, I worked in various eLearning design roles on a contract basis with private companies and K-12 and higher education institutions throughout Pennsylvania and the mid-Atlantic region, primarily developing courses and materials to train teachers in effective online/technology enhanced instructional strategies. You can find my CV on this site. 

I earned my B.S. in Secondary Education here at Penn State in 2012 and went on to complete my M.Ed. in Instructional Design & Technology at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. While I was in graduate school I worked as a long-term substitute teacher and journalist. My journalism work has been published in various formats in both local and national news outlets.

I do occassionally take up freelance work in both writing and learning design. [Email me](mailto:{{site.email}}) to discuss your next project.
